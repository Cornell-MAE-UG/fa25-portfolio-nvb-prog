## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Nitish_Bhamidipati_Headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is Nitish Bhamidipati, and I am a sophomore studying Biomedical Engineering on the pre-medical track. The first question people usually ask when they realize I'm "BME pre-med" is why I'm an engineer if I'm pre-med. I actually find that question quite funny because to me medicine and engineering are very similar. I view them both as extremely complicated subjects that require expert understanding but at the same time involve new problems that you are not prepared for, and your job is to solve them. Beyond my love for biomedical devices and BME research in general, I believe that being an engineer will complement my pre-med journey by giving me the tools to solve complex medical issues both as a doctor and as a researcher examining possible new treatments and methodologies. At Cornell, I am constantly looking for ways to expand my experiences and go in more depth on my interests in device building and life sciences research.
